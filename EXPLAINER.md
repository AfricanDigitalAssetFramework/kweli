# Kweli: Implementation of the ADAF Self-sovereign Identity Framework

The core instance of Kweli is an exchange for verifiable credentials required by the AU Movement Protocol. Kweli will provide a public registry that will define schemas for credentials issued by the African Union Trade Council to organizations and companies in member states to be used for transactions within signatories of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement. Kweli’s registry shall be served	on a platform which	creates	a network of verified organizations	enabling trusted business transactions, supporting trade	between	parties	in different jurisdictions in the AfCFTA block.

## Contents of the	Kweli registry

-  Licensing schemas

-  Business Registration schemas

-  Regulatory Permits schemas

## Steps

1.  User enrols on Kweli and their SSI credentials are stored on their wallet.

2.  User requests the AU Trade Council via Kweli for a new business registration.

3.  A new business is registered and the corresponding documents sent to user's Kweli account.

## Use	Case

Shiro runs a fish export business from Mozambique where her fish is harvested and processed to be sold in	Botswana and Chad. Her business requires formal registration to operate in	her country. She	also requires health approvals from food and public health inspectors. For Shiro to transport her	cargo to the markets in	Chad and Botswana, she needs business permits to have the cargo	move across	borders. The entire	process	to enable her get formal registration up to	the	point where	she is able to export to her customers in Africa, requires a lot of man-hours and could run up	to months before she gets to run her business flow	smoothly. Not to mention legal compliance of her documents with respective jurisdictions	and	bribes she may be compelled	to	give to	facilitate	her transactions.

### With AfCFTA

However, Shiro’s hassles in	moving her cargo across	borders	within Africa are lessened when she transacts under the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, especially with the support of the Movement Protocol. AfCFTA enables her to trade freely with countries within the trade area while the Movement Protocol allows her to	move across borders	of AU member states with minimal restrictions.

### With Kweli

Kweli eases the	process	that Shiro goes through	to register her	business and operate it	under the AfCFTA block. On a local instance of Kweli for her home-country	of Mozambique, Shiro enrols for	an SSI	backed user profile, which she can use to access instances of Kweli	deployed in	AU member states.	She	then accesses a	Kweli web portal through which she selects her preferred business instance and gets it registered. Once registered, the registration credentials for her business	are stored in her account. She uses these to request for licenses she may need as well as permits she would require to trade in the AfCFTA block.

1.  Shiro	signs up on Kweli for a new user account.

2.  Her Verinym DID is created and stored	on her Kweli interoperable wallet.

3.  Shiro selects her business type from provided options on a Kweli instance	and proceeds to register her business. She receives	a business registration	certificate	to prove legal existence. This is	stored in a	new	Business Profile.

4.  She applies for a Fishing license, Food Safety license and an Export license, which are stored	alongside the business registration	certificate	in her Business’ Profile.

5.  Shiro requests for an AfCFTA Trade Permit on Kweli.	This is	issued after qualification of having the prior documents (Business Certificate and Appropriate licenses).

6.  Shiro’s fish trading business is finally legally registered and approved to transact within the Trade Area.

7.  If she needs to expand her business to another line of product, say importing	Gum arabic from South Sudan, she only needs to request for import licenses and related appropriate permits.
